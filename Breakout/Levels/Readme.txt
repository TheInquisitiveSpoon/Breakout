TO create a level using the notepad, you must place each block where you want under the format:

Block	number of lives block has 	x-axis 		y-axis

for example a line of Purple blocks followed by a line of green blocks will be

Block	1	0	0
Block	1	1	0
Block	1	2	0
Block	1	3	0
Block	1	4	0
Block	1	5	0
Block	1	6	0
Block	1	7	0
Block	1	8	0
Block	1	9	0
Block	1	10	0
Block	1	11	0
Block	1	12	0
Block	1	13	0

Block	2	0	1
Block	2	1	1
Block	2	2	1
Block	2	3	1
Block	2	4	1
Block	2	5	1
Block	2	6	1
Block	2	7	1
Block	2	8	1
Block	2	9	1
Block	2	10	1
Block	2	11	1
Block	2	12	1
Block	2	13	1

This will appear as:
 y 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 11 12 13
x 
0  P  P  P  P  P  P  P  P  P  P  P  P  P  P

1  R  R  R  R  R  R  R  R  R  R  R  R  R  R
